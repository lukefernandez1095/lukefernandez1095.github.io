	Second, I would be able to work in a well-known Singaporean corporation in the Central Business District of KL instead of moving to Singapore where the cost of living is relatively high compared to Malaysia. 
	Furthermore, the benefits provided by the company, dental and medical coverage are very important. In addition, I will we able to work with both website and mobile applications.

<h1> A plan for improvement </h1>

<p>
	The biggest obstacle right now that I will overcome is not being proficient in Mandarin. 
	As such, I will take classes in order to pick up the language. 
	There are a number of centers in Malaysia that offer Mandarin classes for adults. 
	As for my skills, I will also take classes or learn through YouTube tutorials on how to work Photoshop and other related Adobe software. 
	In order to build a stronger portfolio, I will have to undertake an internship program at a UI/UX design company while working on my own projects to showcase during the interview.
