<h1> What do the results of these tests mean for me? </h1>
<p>
	The three tests revealed a lot regarding my personality that was scarily accurate and my learning style as well as suggestions on the best ways for my learning to type to best learn. 
	This means I should definitely change my style of learning since the test revealed that I learn best by touching and doing, a more �hands-on� learner which now that I reflect back is actually quite true and makes sense as I always excelled when I would practice what I learn instead of just watching it being taught and not trying out. 
	Furthermore, the personality tests were a real eye opener especially the Myer-Briggs personality test as it revealed how my personality type strengths and weakness, how my romantic relationships would be as well as my potential career path and workplace habit. 
	Since I know now how my personality would be, I can act accordingly and change some habits that would not be good in the work place as well work on the weaknesses of my personality type.  
</p>

<h1> How would these results influence my behavior in a team? </h1>
<p>
	In a team, I would be very passionate and energetic about my work especially if it allows my creativity and imagination to be unleashed. 
	I would go all in, dedicate my time, energy and thoughts to a project. 
	Furthermore, I would be 100% dedicated to a project. 
	I would be the creative outlet in the team and see things from unconventional perspective. 
	No idea is too crazy. I would be a shy person and would not want to be at the center of attention but would be always ready to help anyone in need. 
	I would also be the open-minded and flexible one and would give the benefit of the doubt to my team mates and would also support others� action if I think it�s right. 
	However, rules would be a problem as my personality type does not like to be constrained by them.
</p>

<h1> How should I take this into account when forming a team? </h1>
<p>
	When forming a team, I would look for the same attributes in my team mates and not people that are dictators. 
	People who are also passionate and hardworking would be a major bonus to me. 
	I value hard work and dedication above talent. 
	Furthermore, when forming a team, I believe it is a must for my team mates to be open-minded as well and listen to all ideas presented before making a decision as anyone could have a game changing idea. 
	I would also like people who are focused and are able not to get side tracked as I know my personality type and speaking from experience that I get easily side track and dislike dealing with data, numbers. 
	I get lost in the big picture that I forget the small stuff that make up that picture. 
	Group mates that are able to bring me back down or handle that would be a welcomed addition.
