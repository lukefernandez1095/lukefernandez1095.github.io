<h1> Project Idea: Point & Click Game </h1>

<h1> Overview </h1>
<p>	
	The project will be a simple point and click game made in Gamemaker. 
	The game will be a spot the difference game in which players will be given a floor of tiles with patterns on them. 
	Certain tiles have different patterns that differentiate them from the rest of the tiles and it is up to the player to find and remove those tiles. However, since the differences are not obvious and are very small, players will need to zoom in and carefully inspect the tiles using a magnifying glass which will be the mouse scroller. 
	After identifying the tiles, they can discard it and win the game.
</p>

<h1> Motivation </h1>
<p>
	For me, this project would be interesting for two reasons. 
	The first being that it would require me to get accustomed with Java programming again. 
	This could prove challenging as I have not practiced Java since first year of university but I want to do it as it would a great opportunity to learn it again and refresh my memory. 
	The second is using Gamemaker again also after a long time of not using. Java and Gamemaker go hand in hand with each other as Gamemaker uses Java programming language to code the games. 
	As such, it would be a golden opportunity to be able to refresh my skills by doing this project.
</p>

<h1> Description </h1>
<p>
	The game is of the point and click genre in which the mechanic is simply move the cursor and click on the selected the object. 
	The story of the game is that you are an art inspector that has just received new tile sets and it is your job to check it out before the museum puts it on display. 
	You grab your trusty magnifying glass and begin the inspection. 
	The game only has three scenes which is the main menu, instruction page and the game scene. The instruction page will provide a summary of the controls and objective. 
	The game will be featuring a 640 pixel by 480-pixel screen and only available on PC. 
	The magnifying mechanic will be controlled with the mouse and the WASD buttons to move around. 
	There is no time limit so users will be free to take their time and search. When selected, the tiles that are different will be highlighted in a different color to let the players know that they have selected the right/different tile. 
	Visual feedback is key. The scroller will allow for the zooming function. There will 	a place to discard the tiles that are different. 
	Having simple controls for me is very important as I would want this product to be able to be used by those young and old as well as those who are not tech savvy. 
	There will also be comforting 80ï¿½s video game music in the background to give that calming effect.

<h1> Tools & Technologies </h1>
<p>
	In order to create this game, the software required would be Gamemaker. It is completely free to download for personal use unless one is planning on releasing it to the public then a paid version is available with the related licenses. 
	However, since this is just for class use the free version is fine. 
	Photoshop would be another software that could be used if one prefers in order to create the art assets but Gamemaker has an inbuilt software that allows you to create pixelated assets. 
	As such, Gamemaker alone would be enough to create the game and the art assets required.
</p>

<h1> Skills Required </h1>
<p>
	The skills required for this project would be firstly knowledge of Java programming. Gamemaker does have block codes where you can simply drag and drop commands but that can only go so far. Manually coding would be best. 
	Second would be some basic knowledge of Gamemaker and its functionality. 
	Having basic knowledge of the various functions of Gamemaker would definitely be plus point. 
	Furthermore, being able to create simple art assets, be it in Gamemaker itself or using a software like Photoshop would definitely be needed. 
	The assets need not be complex but simple pixel art would be sufficient for the game to function.
</p>

<h1> Outcome </h1>
<p>
	If the project is successful, it would provide a fun and challenging experience for everyone who plays the game especially those that like puzzle games. 
	Furthermore, this game would require lots of patience and precision when inspecting each tile to find the odd one out. 
	My hope is that this game will also shed some light as to what people with eye sight difficulties have to go through on a daily basis just like a student in our class does each day.
